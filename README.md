## How to play:
It sounds complicated, but don't worry it's not that bad:
1. Every week you will generate three streamflow forecasts:
   - **Seasonal Forecast**: A weekly forecast for each of the 16 weeks of the semester using only the observed streamflow through the start of the semester.
   - **One week forecast**: A forecast for the streamflow next week using the data up to this week.
   - **Two week forecast**: A forecast for the streamflow two weeks from now using the data up to this week.

2. Streamflow forecasts are due by Monday at noon. Late forecasts  will not be accepted for the competition and will receive 0 points. The forecasting timelines are provided in the dates files contained in this folder.

3. Every week your forecast entries should be entered in your csv in the *forecast_entries* folder. All values should be entered as weekly average flow in **cubic feet per second [cfs]**

## How to get points:
First a disclaimer: Note that this scoring is only for the forecasting competition. For your class grade, submitting a forecast on time according to the instructions for the week will give you full credit regardless of how well your forecast rates with respect to others.

That said there will be prizes for the forecast competition (described below) and the scoring will be follows:

 - 2 points to the closest weekly forecast and 1 point to the second and third place forecasts awarded every week (ties are allowed and in that case all tied parties gets the same points)
 - 2 points to the closest 2 week forecast and 1 point to the second and third place forecasts awarded every week (ties are allowed and in that case all tied parties gets the same points)
 - 3 points to be awarded by the evaluator for the week to three *different* people based on whatever criteria the evaluator chooses (literally anything -- most wrong, best consistency between forecasts, most extreme forecast, greatest difference in one week vs two week performance). The only constraints are: (1) the evaluator cannot give points to themselves or the top three students on the current leaderboard and (2) they most show their work (e.g. a graph or a table)
 - The seasonal forecasts will be scored based on the RMSE across all 16 weeks for a given forecast at the end of the semester. With 2 points to the closest and 1 point to the second and third place scores for every forecast issued (i.e. there will be 15 sets of points awarded one for each week that seasonal forecasts were issued). We will keep a running tab on how everyone's seasonal forecasts are doing throughout the semester as observations come in but points will only be awarded at the end.

    *NOTE: I reserve the right to change the rules and award bonus points as I see fit throughout the semester to keep things interesting :)*

 # Prizes
1. Every week the top scorer(s) for that week (i.e. just the points being awarded in the week not the overall score) will get a free pass on the written portion of the following week's assignment. Winners will still do the assignment and submit your forecast but can skip the written explanation part. The free pass is only good for the week following the winning.

2. At the end of sections one and two, the top three scorers overall will get an additional free pass on a writing assignment to be used any week they want in addition to three bonus points to be distributed to anyone other than themselves however they see fit.

3. At the end of semester the overall winner will be crowned and they will get a 5% bump on their overall course grade. Second and third place will receive a 3% bump.

## Evaluator Job Description :

Each week one or two people will be assigned the job of 'Forecast Evaluator'. Your job description is as follows:

1. **Make an improvement to the functionality of our forecast analysis scripts**. For example, you could make a graphical summary output, add something to autogenerate our leaderboard, move analysis into functions, add documentation, etc. Additional suggestions are also included at the top of each script but you can feel free to make whatever addition you would like. Note that your additions should be made directly to the evaluation scripts in the **evaluation_scripts** folder so that we can continuously build on people's improvements. Once your additions have been made you will submit a pull request for  me to review your changes and merger your branch (this is covered in the detailed instructions). You should submit your pull request by Monday morning at 8am so that  I can review your code changes and merge your branch.

2. **Run the forecast evaluation scripts to score the weekly forecasts** after the forecast submission deadline (noon on Monday). You will be evaluating two forecasts (1) the one week forecast from last week and (2) the two week forecast from  two weeks ago

3. **Assign your bonus points**.  You can use literally whatever criteria you want to assign bonus  points as long as you provide some rational for how you did it, and only use python to evaluate whatever criteria you choose.  Also, note the scoring rules above that you can't give bonus points to  yourself of anyone already receiving points in a given week.

4. **Update the scoreboard, seasonal forecast leaders and weekly points awarded** at the top of this readme.

5. **Make a short presentation for Tuesday class.**  Your slides should b include the following (1) summarizing the points awarded this week, (2) the current scores and how they changed, (3) how you awarded your bonus points and, (4) what functionality you added to our forecast calculation.

**NOTE 1: If there are two evaluators for a week**:
  - You should each make **your own** functionality improvement.
  - I recommend coordinating on this beforehand so you aren't working in the same part of the scripts.
  - Talk to your partner and come prepared the week before your assigned week with an idea of what you each would like to do.
  - You should choose the assignments of bonus points together though and make a single presentation that includes both of your additions.

**Note 2: You can start working functionality addition before the forecasts have actually been submitted**  you only need to wait to run your final scoring until Monday at noon. For the analysis, you can start on it anytime and test that it's working with the existing data from previous weeks. You can start doing your functionality addition on Tuesday the week before its due once the previous group has finished. If possible you should submit the pull request by the Friday before your assignment is  due but at a minimum you must do this by Monday morning at 8 am.

**Note 3: Refer to the readme in the evaluation_scripts folder for step  by step instructions on running the analysis**. If your functionality addition changes the instructions make sure you update them when you are done.
